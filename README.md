# YelpCamp

My first experience at building a Web Application that employs a 'Yelp-Style' rating system to compare campgrounds across the United States.

http://stormy-savannah-38066.herokuapp.com/

In this project, I used:
Languages: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3
Frameworks: Express, EJS, Node, Mongoose, Bootstrap
Tools: Git/GitHub, Ubuntu, MongoDB, Heroku, VS Code

This project demonstrates several key web-development concepts:
HTTP Request/Response Cycle
HTML and CSS FrontEnd
NPM Backend
REST Basics
Database Management
Cookies
Sessions
Authentications

Feel free to add suggestions to my code!
