# YelpCamp

# My first experience at building a Web Application that employs a 'Yelp-Style' rating system to compare campgrounds across the United States.

# In this project, I used:
# Languages: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3
# Frameworks: Express, EJS, Node, Mongoose, Bootstrap
# Tools: Git/GitHub, Ubuntu, MongoDB, Heroku, VS Code

# This project demonstrates several key web-development concepts:
# HTTP Request/Response Cycle
# HTML and CSS FrontEnd
# NPM Backend
# REST Basics
# Database Management
# Cookies
# Sessions
# Authentications

# Feel free to add suggestions to my code!
